Products
========

| `Using product attributes`_ - Before creating products, you need to
  create some attributes that you will
| use to differentiate your products. Read here to learn about how to
  create, edit, and making some attributes optional.

| `Products & Variations`_ - Finally, you can create products! Follow
  the directions in this section on the
| most common use cases.

| `Purchasable Entities`_ - When it comes to product architectures,
  there is no one true answer.
| Furthermore, different clients might have different needs. That’s why
  it’s important for Commerce 2.x to support any
| number of product architectures.
