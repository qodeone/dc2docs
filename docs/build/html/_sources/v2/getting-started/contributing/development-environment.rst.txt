Getting ready for development
=============================

Preparing the local environment
-------------------------------

| Start by setting up a web server, PHP and MySQL.
| We recommend `Drupal VM`_ for advanced users, `Acquia Dev Desktop`_
  for beginners.

| You will also need `Git`_ and `Composer`_.
| Note that Drupal VM comes with Composer included.

Getting Commerce
----------------

The following command will download Drupal 8 + Commerce 2.x with all
dependencies to the ``mystore`` folder:

::

    composer create-project drupalcommerce/project-base mystore --prefer-source --stability dev

| The –prefer-source option tells Composer to use Git clone as the
  download method.
| When prompted, answer n to:

::

    Do you want to remove the existing VCS (.git, .svn..) history? [Y,n]?

This will keep the downloaded git repositories inside their parent
folders (such as ``web/modules/contrib/commerce``).

Tips:

-  The ``bin`` folder contains `Drupal Console`_ and `PHPUnit`_.
-  The ``web`` folder represents the document root.
-  Composer commands are always run from the site root (``mystore`` in
   this case).
-  Downloading additional modules:
   ``composer require "drupal/devel:1.x-dev"``
-  Updating an existing module: ``composer update drupal/address``
   –with-dependencies

See the `project-base README`_ for more details.

Preparing your fork
-------------------

**Note:** You will need a GitHub account for contributing.

| Visit the Commerce `repository on GitHub`_ and click the **fork**
  button.
| That will create a copy of the repository on your GitHub account.

Now go to the Commerce folder and add your fork:

::

    cd web/modules/contrib/commerce
    git remote add fork git@github.com:YOUR_USER/commerce.git

Replace YOUR\_USER with your username (the full url is shown on your
fork’s GitHub page).

You will now be able to push new branches to your fork and create `pull
requests`_ against the main repository.

Running tests
-------------

All of the Drupal Commerce tests are based on the PHPUnit framework. In
order to run the tests you will need to copy the ``phpunit.xml.dist``
from the core directory and modify it for your environment. An in depth
article on getting ready to run the tests can be found here:

::

    cd mystore/web
    # Run PHPUnit tests
    ../bin/phpunit -c core/phpunit.xml modules/contrib/commerce
