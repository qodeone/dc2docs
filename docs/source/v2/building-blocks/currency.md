## Overview

Commerce without borders means we support every language and every denomination of currency. This is a big undertaking because not only do we need to support various currencies, we need to support their regional formatting rules, what each currency is called in every other language, and many other difficult problems. 

Commerce 2's currency support is built upon the [commerceguys/intl](https://github.com/commerceguys/intl) library which provides a list of currencies, currency formatting, countries, and languages. This list in not something we cooked up on the back of a napkin, the intl library uses the internationally-recognized standard of [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/) data. We parse the CLDR definitions into our own more compact YAML definitions and use them to re-implement intlâ€™s NumberFormatter and provide currency, country, language data.

## Importing Defined Currencies

If you navigate to ``admin/commerce/config/currency`` and click on the "Import" tab, you will see a simple dropdown that shows you all the supported currencies (157 active currencies).

When imported, a configuration entity called "commerce_currency" is created with all the relevant data from the CLDR definition. Once imported, the configuration entity is unique to your installation, which means you can make minor changes to formatting and not worry about an update reverting your changes.

Also, thanks to the CLDR dataset, we import all the translations of the currency you are importing for all the languages you have in your site. A small, but very practical and helpful time saver.

## Creating and Editing Currencies
